# Thread-Communication

## About
Using threads for a producer-consumer problem. We have a single process which contains two threads. The aim is to use thread communication and send some values from one thread to other. The code uses the global memory of the process to do so.

## How to use

The code works only on Linux as it is open source. You need to run the Makefile first by writing 'make all' in Shell.
